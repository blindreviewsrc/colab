# Examples and Tutorials on using Google Colab and Gradio to create Online Interactive Student Learning Modules

Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and trends, including 
a need to allow students to learn experimentally from
simulation, allow for innovation in education. Jupyter note-
books (JNB), run using Google Colab and improved for edu-
cational purposes using the Gradio Python library, can help
generate effective online teaching resources while being
relatively easy for students to install and run. This work
shows how to create and extend JNBs for a broad class of
computing educational subjects, focusing our effort on pro-
viding examples in digital systems and computer architec-
ture. Specifically, we provide tutorials on creating learner
modules with Gradio and Colab and provide and classify
a set of exemplar modules that focus on helping students
learn digital systems or computer architecture. Our overall
goal is to offer other educators access to these tools and an
understanding of how and what can be created for a broad
range of online computational education resources.
